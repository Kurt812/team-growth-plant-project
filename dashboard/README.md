# ðŸŒ± Liverpool Natural History Museum - Plant Health Monitoring Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard is a key component of the Liverpool Natural History Museum's plant monitoring project. It provides an interactive interface for visualising real-time and historical plant health data. The dashboard enables museum staff to monitor temperature and soil moisture trends, helping maintain the health of the plants in the botanical wing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Dashboard**:
  - View the latest temperature and soil moisture readings for each plant.
  - Filter plants dynamically using a dropdown menu.
  - Visualise real-time trends through interactive graphs.

- **Historical Data Dashboard**:
  - Query historical data stored in Amazon S3.
  - Allows users to filter data by plant name and date range.
  - Trend charts for historical temperature and soil moisture values.
  - Time-stamped axes for precise data analysis.

## Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard is part of the larger plant monitoring system and relies on the following components:

- Amazon RDS: Stores real-time data for the last 24 hours.
- Amazon S3: Archives historical data in Parquet format for long-term analysis.
- Streamlit: A lightweight web application framework for building interactive dashboards.

## Prerequisites
- An `.env` file with the following variables:
  - `DB_HOST`: Hostname of the RDS instance.
  - `DB_NAME`: Database name.
  - `DB_USER`: Username for the database.
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the database.
  - `DB_PORT`: Port for the database connection.
- Software Requirements:
  - Python 3.9
  - AWS CLI: Configured with access to your S3 bucket.
  - Docker: For running the application in a containerised environment.

## User Interface

- **Navigation**:
  - Real-Time Dashboard: Displays the latest metrics for each plant, including temperature and soil moisture trends.
  - Historical Dashboard: Enables querying historical data by date range and plant name.

- **Visualisations**:
  - Interactive Altair charts for temperature and soil moisture trends.
  - Metrics displayed in the sidebar for quick insights.

## Future Improvements

- Add alerts for anomalous readings (e.g., low soil moisture or high temperature).
- Introduce role-based access controls for dashboard features.
- Optimise historical data querying for large datasets.
